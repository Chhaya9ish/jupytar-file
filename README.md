Hii! showing my first chatbot app  created using codes of python along with generate AI.
step-1: Importing the library  so that it's functions can be used .
step-2:configuring API as API_key is important to interact between softwares.
step-3:initializing the model i.e the brain we want to use in our created model i.e"gemoni-1.5-pro".
step-4:Creating user_prompt , user Prompt is used to make input i.e what we want to our model do for us.
Hence, i have a just started in python this is a simple app i created!
